**Qarai Agent Guard** is a Python library that protects AI agents from security threats.
It inspects data before an agent reads it, stores it, or sends it to a tool.

The library detects these threats:

- Prompt injection
- Jailbreak attempts
- PII leakage
- XML-based attacks
- Secrets exposure

The library supports three detection modes:

- Regex-based detection
- Model-based detection
- Mixed detection

The library ships detection rules for three languages:

- English
- French
- Arabic


## How it works

An application sends a value to `AgentGuard`.
The guard passes the value to its detectors.
Each detector returns a detection result when a rule or model matches.
The policy maps the result to an action.
The application receives the action and reacts to it.

The main components are:

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `AgentGuard` | Central security engine. It runs detectors and applies policy decisions. |
| `Detector` | Identifies a class of threat in a value. |
| `Policy` | Maps detection severities to actions. |
| `PolicyExecutor` | Applies a policy decision to content. |


## Quick start

Install the library:

```bash
pip install qarai-agent-guard
```

Create a guard with one detector and the default policy:

```python
from qarai_agent_guard import AgentGuard, Detector, default_policy

pii_detector = Detector(name="pii", default_rules="pii")

guard = AgentGuard(
    detectors=[pii_detector],
    policy=default_policy(),
)
```

Inspect a value that contains an IBAN:

```python
decision = guard.inspect(
    key="memory",
    value="Please store IBAN FR1420041010050500013M02606 on file for client Amine Trabelsi.",
    operation="write",
)

print(decision.action)   # Action.REDACT
print(decision.reason)   # PII pattern detected in 'memory'
```

The default policy redacts medium-severity matches.
The IBAN has medium severity, so the guard returns the `REDACT` action.

Inspect a value that contains a card number:

```python
decision = guard.inspect(
    key="card",
    value="Cardholder Yassine Gharbi paid with card 4111 1111 1111 1111.",
    operation="write",
)

print(decision.action)   # Action.BLOCK
```

The card number has critical severity.
The default policy returns the `BLOCK` action for critical severity.

Remove sensitive data from a value:

```python
redacted = guard.apply_redactions(
    "Contact jhon.smith@google.com to schedule the demo."
)

print(redacted)
# Contact [REDACTED:email] to schedule the demo.
```
